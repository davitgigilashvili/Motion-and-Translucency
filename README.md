# Motion-and-Translucency
Supplementary Video Materials for the article **"Does Motion Increase Perceived Magnitude of Translucency?"**  presented at 2023 London Imaging Meeting, and published in its conference proceedings.

**Authors: Davit Gigilashvili, David Norman DÄ±az Estrada, and Lakshay Jain** 

A ZIP file "Supplementary Material 1 - Videos" contains videos used in the article.

The ZIP file contains 12 videos that are named in **v01_rOBJ_alpha_0.05_sigT_5_albedo_0.3_7fps.mp4** format. 

- "v01" corresponds to video's number. 

- "rOBJ" means object rotation. "rBG" alternatively means background rotation. 

- "alpha_0.05" means that the roughness of the object is 0.05. 

- "sigT_5" means that the extinction coefficient of the material is 5. 

- "albedo_0.3" means that the subsurface scattering albedo of the material is 0.3.

- "7fps" means that the video contains 7 frames per second.
